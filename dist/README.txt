HI!

Thanks for playing my game :)
If You would like to sell this game (very doubtfull), make a remake of it or just give me a hight five over the internet don't hesitate to write to the adres email above.

I hope that this game explain itself, but in case You are fealing lost or scared and have no idea how to play, here is a short tutorial:

1. Your goal is to score as many points as possible.
2. You gain points by matching the color thingis that comes from the down of the screen to the proper boxes at the top of the screen.
3. You can move the color boxes at the top of the screen by dragging it by Your mouse - try it! it is really easy...
4. This white line in the middle of the screen is the laser, when You press the space button on Your keyboard, it switches the color of the box that it is currently indicating.

Good luck.
